### Why did I choose to take on this project?

My business elective (big data in business and finance) assignment asked us to discuss the potential for big data in business and the opportunities as a result of new technologies. I decided to go hands-on with the assignment and learn the basics of machine learning algorithms. 

### Gist of the project:
After a lot of research, I decided on the Random Forest Regressor model.
- I cleaned the Boston housing dataset
- Made a correlation heat map to better understand the underlying correlations.
- Then made a heat map scatter plot of the various data attributes narrowed down from the output from the heat map scatter plot, there was a clear correlation.
- I split my data into 20/80 test/train.
- Took the train data and fit it to a random forest regressor model
    - With some parameter tuning, I improved the model's success rate from 79% to 84%.
